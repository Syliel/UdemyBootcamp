            A <b>catgirl</b> (猫娘, nekomusume) is a female <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_anthropomorphism#Animals">kemonomimi</a> character with feline
            traits, such as cat ears (猫耳,
            nekomimi), a cat tail, or other feline characteristics on an otherwise human body. Catgirls are found in
            various
            fiction genres and in particular Japanese anime and manga.<sup>[1]</sup>

            <h2>History</h2>

            <p>
                The oldest mention of the term nekomusume comes from a 1700s misemono in which a cat/woman hybrid was
                displayed.[2]
                Stories of shape-shifting bakeneko prostitutes were popular during the Edo Period.[2] The popularity of
                the
                nekomusume continued throughout the Edo and Shōwa periods, with many tales of cat/woman hybrids
                appearing in
                works
                such as the Ehon Sayoshigure (絵本小夜時雨) and Ansei zakki (安政雑記).[2]

        <h3>More History</h3>
        <p>
            In Kenji Miyazawa's 1924 work, Suisenzuki no Yokka (水仙月の四日, literally The 4th of Narcissus Month) is first
            modern
            day
            example of a beautiful, cat-eared woman.[3] In 1936, the nekomusume experienced a revival in kamishibai.[2]
            The
            first anime involving catgirls, titled The King’s Tail (Osama no Shippo), was made in 1949 by Mitsuyo
            Seo.[citation
            needed] In America, the DC Comics character Catwoman first appeared in 1940, and Cheetah first appeared in
            1943.[4]
        </p>
        <h4>Rise to Popularity</h4>
        <p>
            Catgirls were further made popular in 1978 series The Star of Cottonland.[5] By the 1990s, catgirls were
            common
            in
            Japanese anime and manga.[6] Catgirls have since been featured in various media worldwide. Enough of a
            subculture
            has developed for various themed conventions and events to be held around the world, such as Nekocon.[7]4

        <h2>Catboys</h2>
        <p>
            Catboys are the male counterparts to catgirls. Similarly to catgirls, catboys are often seen in manga and
            anime-style art and are associated with hallmarks such as maid dresses. However, whereas catgirls are simply
            women with feline features, catboys are often femboys that employ furry-like personas.[8]
        </p>

        <h3>Why Catboys?</h3>
        <p>
            In late 2020,[9] catboys gained more recognition as femboys became popularized by the app TikTok,[10] with
            many
            of the femboys on the app donning feline accessories due to popular memes that encouraged them to "put on
            the
            cat
            ears"[11] or promoted catboys in general.
