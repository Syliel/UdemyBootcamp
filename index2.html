    <h1>Catgirls</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Catgirls or <a href="#nowhere">kemonomimi</a> are adorable and cute and my favorite anime type characters there
        are. They can do no
        wrong and always need their headpats. You can't own a catgirl. Only catgirls can own you. That's ok. They're
        still cute enough to make life better in
        every way.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many different animes that have catgirls, but there are also a lot of anime that have fake catgirls.
        Fake catgirls are the ones who seem like they have cat ears and tail, but they're really just fake fake fake
        people. They simply wear headbands or tails on their belt loops. Don't be fooled. Although, these characters are
        also very cute, they are not the real thing.

        Sometimes you will see catboys. Now... these creatures can be deceptive. Most of the time they look like girls
        at the beginning, but they're not. Later on in the series you will have a reveal. Don't be shocked. Catboys are
        just as lovely and cute as catgirls and they are not in anyway to be considered a bad outcome, if that's all you
        can find. For instance, Felix the catboy is perfect in every way and you cannot be upset or mad about seeing him
        show up in your feed. God bless Japan.

    <h2>Food for Catgirls</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        It is unknown whether catgirls can eat human food or if they eat cat food, but what I am aware of is their
        insatiable taste for human boys. They will suck a boy dry and have no shame in their deviance. Probably they
        will be all innocent looking inside of a box, begging to be pet or whimpering because it's raining or they have
        no home to go to. This is not the case and is just a trap set by the catgirl to suck your cock dry. They want
        milk. They view you as a cow and are waiting to milk you. Please do yourself a favor and accept the catgirl into
        your home. You will not regret.

    <h3>Speaking of food...</h3>
    <p>
        Apparently, I hear that catgirls can cook. I'm not sure where they got these skills, as they are clearly aliens
        who shouldn't even know what a stove is. But you can see them... standing there when you get home, wearing only
        an apron, backsides uncovered. And it doesn't even matter. Them being nearly nude shouldn't matter to you,
        because you are a virgin boy and couldn't imagine ever touching a girl or even looking at one. So you will
        pretend to not see anything and just enjoy their delicious food. Btw, do you think they cook mostly fish dishes?
        I can't imagine what a cat wants with cow meat...
    </p>
    <h3>Fish</h3>
    <p>
        I have to write another paragraph about this, because it's really got me confused. Sometimes you see them with
        fish in their mouth, looking all innocent and cute. But do these creatures actually eat fish? There was one
        anime where the catgirl acted more cat than girl and I think she only ate fish. Her lips curled up in a :3 like
        manner as she scarfed down her scrumptious fish meal. This bothers me, because fish are inherently disgusting
        and no one should ever eat anything even closely related to this junk.
